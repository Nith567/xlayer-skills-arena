# OKX Token Screener

A data-driven token scanner that combines OKX DEX Signal intelligence (what smart money and whales are buying) with technical indicators (RSI, momentum, volume spike) to surface the highest-opportunity tokens on any chain. The analyst layer behind every trade.

## Pre-flight Checks

> Read `../okx-agentic-wallet/_shared/preflight.md`. If that file does not exist, read `_shared/preflight.md` instead.

## Chain Support

> Read `../okx-agentic-wallet/_shared/chain-support.md` for the full list of supported chain names and chainIndex values. If that file does not exist, read `_shared/chain-support.md` instead.

## Skill Routing

| Need | Skill/Tool |
|---|---|
| Smart money buy signals | `okx-dex-signal` → `onchainos signal list` |
| Live smart money trades | `okx-dex-signal` → `onchainos tracker activities` |
| Top traders (alpha source) | `okx-dex-signal` → `onchainos leaderboard list` |
| Token price + volume history | `okx-dex-market` → `onchainos market kline` |
| Current price | `okx-dex-market` → `onchainos market price` |
| Token security scan | `okx-security` → `onchainos security token-detection` |
| Execute buy after screen | `okx-dex-swap` → `onchainos swap execute` |

---

## Screen Modes

Detect from user message:

| Mode | Trigger | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Money Screen** | "what are smart money buying", "whale signals" | `onchainos signal list --wallet-type 1,3` |
| **KOL Screen** | "KOL picks", "influencer buys" | `onchainos signal list --wallet-type 2` |
| **Technical Screen** | "oversold tokens", "volume spike", "RSI screen" | `onchainos market kline` for each token |
| **Combined Screen** | "best opportunities", "find alpha", "full scan" | signal list + kline for each result |
| **Trend Screen** | "trending tokens", "hot right now" | `onchainos tracker activities` (most traded) |

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1 — Parse Screen Intent

Extract:
- **Mode**: smart_money / kol / technical / combined / trend
- **Chain**: from message, default Base
- **Filters**: RSI threshold, min volume, min market cap, min holders
- **Output**: how many tokens to show (default top 10)

---

### Step 2A — Signal Screen (Smart Money / KOL / Whale)

```bash
# Check chain support first
onchainos signal chains

# Fetch buy signals
onchainos signal list \
  --chain <chainName> \
  --wallet-type 1,3         # 1=Smart Money, 2=KOL, 3=Whale
```

For each signal, key fields:
- `token` — token address + symbol
- `walletType` — who's buying (smart money / KOL / whale)
- `amountUsd` — how much they bought
- `addressCount` — how many wallets buying (consensus signal)
- `soldRatioPercent` — % already sold (low = still holding = bullish)

---

### Step 2B — Technical Screen

For each token from signals (or user's watchlist):

```bash
onchainos market kline \
  --chain <chainId> \
  --token-address <addr> \
  --bar 1D \
  --limit 14
```

**Calculate per token:**

```
RSI (14-day):
  gains  = [max(r, 0) for r in returns[-14:]]
  losses = [abs(min(r, 0)) for r in returns[-14:]]
  RS     = mean(gains) / mean(losses)
  RSI    = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Volume spike:
  avg_vol_7d = mean(volume[-7:])
  today_vol  = volume[-1]
  vol_spike  = today_vol / avg_vol_7d        # >2.0 = significant spike

Momentum (price vs 7d avg):
  sma_7      = mean(closes[-7:])
  momentum   = (price_now - sma_7) / sma_7 × 100

7d return:
  return_7d  = (price_now - price[-7]) / price[-7] × 100
```

---

### Step 3 — Score Each Token (Opportunity Score)

```
opportunity_score =
  (smart_money_score  × 0.35)   ← is smart money buying?
  + (rsi_score        × 0.25)   ← is it oversold?
  + (volume_score     × 0.20)   ← is volume picking up?
  + (momentum_score   × 0.10)   ← price trend direction
  + (safety_score     × 0.10)   ← not a rug

smart_money_score:
  addressCount >= 5  → 100
  addressCount 3–4   → 75
  addressCount 1–2   → 50
  no signal          → 0

  soldRatioPercent < 10% → +20 bonus (still holding)
  soldRatioPercent > 50% → -30 penalty (exiting)

rsi_score:
  RSI < 25  → 100  (extreme oversold = opportunity)
  RSI 25–35 → 80
  RSI 35–45 → 60
  RSI 45–55 → 40
  RSI 55–65 → 20
  RSI > 65  → 0   (overbought)

volume_score:
  vol_spike > 5×  → 100  (massive volume)
  vol_spike 3–5×  → 80
  vol_spike 2–3×  → 60
  vol_spike 1–2×  → 30
  vol_spike < 1×  → 0

momentum_score:
  momentum > +5%  → 100
  momentum 0–5%   → 60
  momentum -5–0%  → 40
  momentum < -5%  → 20

safety_score:
  no risk flags + holders > 10k → 100
  minor risk + holders 1k–10k   → 60
  risk flags present             → 20
  honeypot / critical            → 0  (filtered out)
```

---

### Step 4 — Security Filter

Remove dangerous tokens before showing results:

```bash
onchainos security token-detection \
  --token-addresses <addr1,addr2,addr3...> \
  --chain <chainId>
```

**Auto-remove from results:**
- `isHoneypot == true`
- `riskLevel == critical`
- Token age < 24 hours (too new)
- Holders < 100

---

### Step 5 — Display Ranked Results

```
Token Screener Results — Base (Smart Money + Technical)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Token   Price     RSI   Vol Spike  SM Signal     Sold%  Score  Action
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1   PEPE    $0.0000112  32   3.2×      3 wallets $42k  6%   91    🔥 Strong
2   TOKEN_X $0.0042     28   2.1×      2 wallets $8k   0%   84    📈 Watch
3   DOGE    $0.1014     41   1.8×      5 wallets $91k  12%  79    ✅ Active
4   SHIB    $0.0000183  38   1.4×      1 wallet  $4k   0%   71    ⚠️ Weak SM
5   LINK    $14.20      44   1.2×      0 wallets       —    52    📊 Tech only
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Legend:
🔥 Strong — smart money active + oversold + volume spike (high confidence)
📈 Watch  — good technicals, emerging signal
✅ Active  — established smart money activity
⚠️ Weak   — limited signal, proceed cautiously
📊 Tech   — technical setup only, no smart money confirmation
```

---

### Step 6 — Deep Dive on Any Token

User can ask: "tell me more about PEPE" or "deep dive #1"

```
Token Deep Dive — PEPE (Base)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Price:        $0.0000112   7d: +24.3%  30d: +67.2%
Market Cap:   $4.7B        Holders: 847,000
Liquidity:    $22.4M       (high — easy to exit)

Smart Money Activity:
  3 wallets bought $42,000 total in last 2 hours
  Avg entry: $0.0000109
  Sold ratio: 6% — still holding ✅

RSI (14d):    32 — Oversold (buy signal territory)
Volume spike: 3.2× average (increasing interest)
Momentum:     +2.1% vs 7d avg (slight uptrend)

Security:
  Honeypot:   ✅ No
  Risk level: ✅ Low
  Verified:   ✅ Yes

30d price chart (ASCII):
  0.0000180 ┤    ╭╮
  0.0000140 ┤   ╭╯╰╮
  0.0000100 ┤───╯   ╰──────── ← now
  0.0000060 ┘

Opportunity Score: 91/100 🔥

"Want to buy PEPE? Say 'buy $20 of PEPE'"
→ Routes to okx-dex-swap
```

---

### Step 7 — Watchlist Screening

User can set up a personal watchlist and screen it:

```
"add ETH, WBTC, SOL, PEPE to my watchlist and screen daily"
```

```
CronCreate: daily at 8am
→ For each token in watchlist:
    onchainos market kline → RSI, momentum, volume
    onchainos signal list → any smart money activity?
→ Report tokens crossing thresholds:
    "📊 Daily Watchlist Alert:
     PEPE: RSI dropped to 28 (oversold) — smart money entered 2h ago
     ETH:  RSI 61, no new signals — hold"
```

---

### Step 8 — One-Click Buy After Screen

After showing results, offer direct execution:

```
"buy $30 of #1 (PEPE)"
→ onchainos swap execute --from usdc --to <PEPE_addr> --readable-amount 30 ...

"buy $10 each of top 3"
→ Execute 3 swaps proportionally
```

---

## Preset Screen Filters

| Preset | Description | Filters |
|---|---|---|
| `oversold` | Technically oversold tokens | RSI < 35 |
| `smart-money` | Smart money consensus buys | addressCount >= 3, soldRatio < 20% |
| `volume-spike` | Unusual volume activity | vol_spike > 2.5× |
| `fresh-signal` | Very recent smart money entry | signal < 1 hour old |
| `whale-only` | Only whale-sized buys | wallet-type 3, amount > $10k |
| `full-scan` | All of the above combined | All filters, ranked by score |

---

## Risk Rules

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Honeypot token | Remove from results entirely |
| Sold ratio > 50% | Label "SM EXITING ⚠️" — deprioritize |
| Token < 24h old | Filter out or label "NEW — extreme risk" |
| Score < 40 | Exclude from default results |
| Single wallet signal (no consensus) | Label "weak signal — low confidence" |

---

## Amount Display Rules

- Scores as integers out of 100
- Volume spike as multiplier (`3.2×`)
- Smart money totals in USD (`$42,000`)
- RSI as integer (`32`)
- Always note: *"Signals are based on onchain data. Not financial advice."*
